## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Language:** C# / .NET 6+
- **API Integration:** Vector XL Driver Library (vxlapi64.dll)
- **Architecture:** P/Invoke interoperability for native API access
- **Target Platform:** x64 Windows

## üéØ Project Goals

This project demonstrates:
- Professional automotive software development practices
- Vector ecosystem integration capabilities
- Real-time data processing and analysis
- Scalable architecture for automotive applications

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- .NET 6+ SDK
- Vector XL Driver Library (optional - simulation mode available)

### Building and Running
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Visual Studio
3. Set platform target to x64
4. Build and run (F5)

The application will automatically detect available Vector hardware or switch to simulation mode.
